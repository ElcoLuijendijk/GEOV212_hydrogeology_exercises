    "## 1. Solving differential equations: Euler's method\n",
    "\n",
    "Groundwater flow and many other geological and physical processes such as heat flow, the propagation of seismic waves, etc. can be described by partial differential equations. Unfortunately partial differential equations are often difficult to solve directly. Analytical solutions of some partial differential equations do exist, but these often require strong simplifications. We will use a numerical method to solve the groundwater flow equation, which is based on a method to approximate derivatives that was first proposed by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of a derivative of a variable $y$ over $x$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y'(x) = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{y(x+\\Delta x) - y(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For very small values of $\\Delta x$ the following is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{y(x+\\Delta x) - y(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(x+\\Delta x) \\approx y(x) + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\Delta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although for now this seems like a nice, but not terribly useful rearranging of equations, we will show you how to use this method to numerically solve partial differential equations. Euler's method forms the basis of finite-difference methods, which have enabled scientists to solve partial differential equations for which no analytical solutions exist. These methods have been used to predict all kinds of physical processes."
