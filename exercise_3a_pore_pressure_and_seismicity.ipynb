        "# Case study 1: Diffusion of fluid pressure and seismicity below Mt. Hood\n",
        "\n",
        "We will apply a new transient groundwater flow model to study the relation between fluid pressure and seismicity in the crust below an active volcano, Mt. Hood in Oregon, USA. We will follow a publication by Saar and Manga (2003). The central claim of this paper is that there appears to be a correlation between seasonal recharge and watertable changes and seismicity in the upper crust. Saar and Manga suggest that this may be due to the effect of fluid pressure on seismicity. Groundwater recharge increases the watertable, which in turn increases pore fluid pressure in the crust. High fluid pressure means a lower effective normal stress on fault planes, which makes faults more likely to fail and generate seismic activity. We will use our 1D model to model the seasonal change in fluid pressure in the crust, and will try to quantify the magnitude of changes at a depth of 4500 m, where seismic activity is thought to originate."

A more realistic way to model the effects of seasonal recharge is to include a periodic change in hydraulic head at the top boundary. Saar and Manga (2003) approximate this by using a cosine function (see equation 8). Uncomment the line where a periodic boundary condition is assigned in this notebook (in the transient parameters box below) and complete the line. Add a new box below, copy-paste the line to calculate the boundary condition and inspect the variable by typing ``print(h0)`` in the next line. Or ``print(h0[:100])`` if you want to inspect the first 100 values for instance. Make sure that you are modelling an increase from 0 to 10 m by checking the min and max values of ``h0`` by typing ``h0.min()`` and ``h0.max()``.\n",
