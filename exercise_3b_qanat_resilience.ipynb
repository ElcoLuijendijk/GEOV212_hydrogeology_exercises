    "# Case study 2: Transient groundwater flow towards a spring\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will apply a transient groundwater model to model a transient groundwater flow system. We will look at groundwater discharge to a man-made spring (qanat) and how sensitive this spring is to changes in climate and recharge over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will study the flow of groundwater to a so-called *qanat*, a man-made horizontal tunnel that taps the groundwater table and provides a year-round supply of groundwater. These qanats can be found in the Middle East, North Africa and Spain and predominantly date back to Roman times. We will study a qanat in northern Syria that has been restored in the early 2000s and provides a stable supply of groundwater to a small village called Shallalah Sagireh (little waterfall). The qanat dates back to at least the Byzantine age, since a Byzantine artefact was found in the tunnel during restoration work. Currently the qanat provides approx. 0.4 L/s of water on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the question on how vulnerable qanats like these are to multi-year droughts. In practice we will use a 1D transient model of groundwater flow to simulate the steady-state initial flow to the qanat, and then model the change in flow after we have set the recharge to a value of 0.\n"

    "We will first discuss the workflow below. A brief summary of the workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the model parameters and run the steady state model\n",
    "2. Adjust K and S untill you get a reasonable water level (ie, make sure the qanat is not dry)\n",
    "3. Fix the hydraulic head at the source of the qanat to make sure that groundwater discharges into the qanat\n",
    "4. Turn off groundwater recharge, run the transient model and monitor the discharge into the qanat to quantify how long it takes before the qanat runs dry\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go through these steps. The Python code to run the model is located below the explanation text blocks. Note that the steps below explain how to change this model code to model the system that we are interested in, so you are expected to change the code.\n"

    "### Set up model variables\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will set variables to model our qanat system. The model setup is shown schematically in Fig. 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is 5.3 km long. Adjust the variable ``x`` in the code below to make sure the model has the correct dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cross section starts at the central part of the valley at some distance from the qanat, where groundwater levels are relatively steady at 300 m above sea level. Use this as a value for h0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aquifer thickness is unknown, but is roughly estimated as 200 m. The transmissivity (=the product of hydraulic conductivity and aquifer tickness, K * b) of the aquifer has been estimated using an unpublished numerical model study for the larger surrounding area (Khanasser Valley) as 1.3 * 10^-5^ m^2^ s^-1^. This value is a first estimate, we will probably need to adjust this to get the watertable right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storarivity of the limestone rocks in which the formation was dug is probably relatively low. The formation is unconfined, so the storativity is dominated specific yield, which tends to be orders of magnitude higher than the elastic response of water and the rock matrix (=specific storage). We will use a first estimate of specific yield of 0.15.\n",
    "\n",
    "The qanat is fed by recharge from the basalt plateau. Once upon a time I quantified recharge using the chloride mass balance (Luijendijk & Bruggeman 2008), ie. by looking at the difference in chloride concentration between groundwater and precipitation. The long-term average groundwater recharge was found to be 12 mm/yr, but with a large uncertainty range: 7 to 19 mm/yr. This is only a small fraction of the precipitation of approx. 300 mm/yr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the chloride concentration of groundwater and the groundwater level contours suggest that recharge occurs only on the basalt plateau. In our model cross-section the basalt plateau runs from x=4100 m to x=5300 m. To accommodate lateral changes in recharge we should define recharge as an array instead of a single number. We can tell the script to vary recharge like this:\n",

In reality while digging the tunnel the diggers will probably have continued until they hit the groundwater table, and a little while further to capture as much water as possible. Make sure your simulated watertable is (somewhat) realistic, and report your best-estimate of the value of K, the hydraulic head at the source of the qanat and make a figure of the modeled watertable.\n",
    "2. Simulate the transient change of flow to the qanat over time in case of a multi-year drought (ie. set the recharge to 0). Repeat using three different estimates of storativity. Look up typical variation of specific yield of consolidated carbonates online, in handbooks and/or your lecture notes. Report (inc. figures) how long it lasts until the qanat runs completely dry and at what stage the flow has reduced to 50% of the initial** value.\n",
    "3. Change the value of recharge at the basalt plateau to its minimum and maximum estimate (7 mm/yr and 19 mm/yr). Readjust the initial steady-state value of hydraulic conductivity to maintain a realistic initial watertable and rerun the transient calculations. Again report how long it lasts until the qanat runs dry. What parameter is more important in determining the ‘resilience’ of the qanat, recharge, K or storativity?\n",
