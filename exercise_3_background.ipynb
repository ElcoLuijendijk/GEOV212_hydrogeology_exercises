    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will move from simulating steady-state diffusion to transient (time-dependent) diffusion of fluids in the crust. We will first construct a numerical model of transient fluid flow and then apply this model to a real world case study. You will have the choice between two case studies, one in which we compare predictions of our 1D model to data on seismicity induced by changes in hydraulic head and pore pressure at depth and a second case study where we will study the resilience of a spring to a change in precipitation and recharge. \n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn to simulate transient fluid, heat or solute transport in the crust\n",
    "* Learn to combine numerical models and geoscience datasets to study geological processes.\n",
    "* Learn how fluid transport behaves over long(ish) timescales\n",

    "## Solving the transient diffusion equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In exercise 1 and 2 we used Euler's method to solve the steady-state groundwater flow equation. Euler's method for solving partial differential equations is to discretize derivatives: ie. to quantify derivatives at a discrete interval. Mathematically the method looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\dfrac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = \\dfrac{h(x+\\Delta x) - h(x)}{\\Delta x}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where *h(x+$\\Delta$ x)* denotes the value of *h* at position $x + \\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will again use Euler's method to solve the partial differential equation of transient groundwater flow, which is a so-called diffusion equation. First we simplify the diffusion equation to a 1D depth integrated equation by replacing $\\nabla q$ by $\\partial  q/ \\partial x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    S\\dfrac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = - \\dfrac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}  + W\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where q is a flux of fluid, heat or solutes. In this equation we have 2 derivatives, one derivative of the variable *h* over time, $\\dfrac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}$, and one derivative of the flux (*q*) over space ($\\dfrac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets discretize these following Euler's method. First, lets get rid of the spatial derivative of the flux (*q*):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    S\\dfrac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial t} = - \\dfrac{q_{i+1/2} - q_{i-1/2}}{2 \\Delta x} + W\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The subscript ~i+1/2~ means the flux (*q*) from node *i* to the next node over *i+1*. Similarly subscript ~i-1/2~ means the flux (*q*) from the node before the current one (*i-1*) to the current node (*i*).\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation the index term *i* denotes the position in space and *j* denotes the timestep. *i* would be the current node, *i-1* one node to the left, *i+1* one node to the right. Similarly, *j* is the current timestep, *j+1* is the next timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rearrange this equation to yield an equation for the value of variable *u* at timestep *j+1*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    h_{i,j+1} = - \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{S} \\dfrac{q_{i+1/2,j} - q_{i-1/2,j}}{2 \\Delta x} + \\dfrac{\\Delta t W}{S} + h_{i,j}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation simply states that the value of variable *h* at node position *i* and timestep *j+1* is a function of of the flux towards this node at timestep *j*, a source term *W* and the value of the variable at the previous timestep *j*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the equation we need to calculate the flux towards node *i*. We can do this again by applying Euler's method. The equation for a groundwater flux is Darcy's law:\n",

    "## Transient diffusion in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have two equations to solve the transient diffusion equation, one equation that calculates the flux *q* at timestep *j* and one that calculates the value of variable *h* at timestep *j+1* using the flux at timestep *j* and the value of *h* at timestep *j*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two equations are implemented in a Python code in two notebooks. We will use this code and adjust the variables to model your fluid flow problem of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the code where the transient diffusion equation is solved looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~~python\n",
    "for j in range(1, n_timesteps):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # calculate the flux between nodes\n",
    "    q = -K * (h[j-1, 1:] - h[j-1, :-1]) / dx\n",
    "\n",
    "    # set specified variable value at the left-hand node:\n",
    "    h[j, 0] = h0[j]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # implement no-flow boundary condition at right-hand side:\n",
    "    q_bottom = 0.0\n",
    "    h[j, -1] = h[j-1, -1] + (dt/S) * (-(q_bottom - q[-1])/dx) + (dt / S) * W[-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # update nodes in the middle:\n",
    "    h[j, 1:-1] = h[j-1, 1:-1] + (dt/S)*(-(q[1:] - q[:-1])/dx) + (dt/S) * W[1:-1]\n",
    "~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "This part contains a loop through all timesteps (``for j in range(1, n_timesteps):``). Any line that is indented (shifted to the right) below this for loop is considered part of the loop by Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next Python calculates the fluid flux between each node in your numerical model ``q = -K * (h[j-1, 1:] - h[j-1, :-1]) / dx``. Hopefully by now you recognise that this is Darcy's law of fluid flow, where fluid flow is a function of the hydraulic gradient (``(h[j-1, 1:] - h[j-1, :-1]) / dx``) and the hydraulic conductivity (``K``). The index ``[j-1, 1:]`` means that Python looks at the value of h at the last timestep (``j-1``) and then looks at all the nodes except the first one (``1:``).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next there are three lines that calculate the hydraulic head at the left, middle and right-hand nodes at the current timestep j as a function of the flux (q), the size of the timestep, storativity and the value of hydraulic head at the last timestep (``h[j-1]``). For the top node the hydraulic head is fixed ``h[j, 0] = h0[j]``. For the lowest node ``h[j, -1]`` the flux from the bottom is 0. This ensures that there is no fluid flow over the bottom boundary of our system. For the middle nodes the hydraulic head at the new timestep is simply a function of how much water flows towards or away from it ((q[1:] - q[:-1])/dx), along with the hydraulic head at the previous timestep, storativity and timestep size."
