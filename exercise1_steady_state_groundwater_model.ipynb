Below is a conceptual model of groundwater flow in a permeable rock unit that is bounded by a stream on the left, and is fed by groundwater recharge (shown by $R$). The hydraulic head is a function of the amount of recharge that enters the system, the frictional resistance that the porous rocks exert on the groundwater and the level of the stream. The reason for choosing this model is that is the simplest model that I could think of that is still somewhat realistic and useful.\n",
